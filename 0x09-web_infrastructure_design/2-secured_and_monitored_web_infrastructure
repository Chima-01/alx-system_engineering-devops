# Implement a three server web infastructure
# Added a web monitoring, firewall and ssl certification

For every additional element, why you are adding it
Added an ssl certificate verifiction system to verify website as client
added A firewall to protect load-balamcer from cyber attcak
added a monitoring system to monitor backend server

What are firewalls for
Firewalls are security rules implemented on web system to properly scruntized traffic coming in and out
in a web system.
They are implemented both in client side and server side.

Why is the traffic served over HTTPS
Traffics are served over https to ensure encrypted transmission of data across client and server on the internet.
Implements an handshake connection between servers and client.

What monitoring is used for
Monitoring involves applying and analysing data and various metrics to check if a system, web server or database is functioning effectively.
Monitoring also allows detection of faults early for easy troubleshoot.

How the monitoring tool is collecting data
Monitoring tool collects data through log analysis in this system log files are recived from server and tools reads and converts to a meaning information

API's and integration
Monitoring tools collects data from apis in server side

SNMP(Simple Network management protocol)
collects data from router, firewalls to calculate performance data on the webs

Agent-Based Monitoring software for specific needs are embeded in the monitoring system.

Explain what to do if you want to monitor your web server QPS
Queries per second (QPS) this a metric used to measure the rate a system can process a query or requests

Select monitoring
pick are particular tool to monitor database

Access the monitoring tool database and analyse the qps data
Utilize data and uptimize server connection.

Why terminating SSL at the load balancer level is an issue
Backend serves recieves unencryted log exposing information to public if compromised
Exposes load balancer to different cyber attacks since the it transmit to server is not encrypted.

Why having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes is an issue
depends on which system being used they might be data loss when traffic high.
single point of failure(SPOF) when there a failure in software the whole database will go down

Why having servers with all the same components (database, web server and application server) might be a problem
inefficiencient use of resource speed, optimazation are not handled in this syatem.
Limited flexibility system doesn't give room for flexibility in case break down of a particular server to switch becomes a problem.
Maintainance and repair will be more complex and time consuming.
