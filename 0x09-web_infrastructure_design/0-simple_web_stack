You must be able to explain what the issues are with this infrastructure
1.Single point of failure (spof): In this system webserver could be exposed to lots of casaulties with could result to breakdown of server.
No back-up: if serves breaks dowwn web connection is lost
2.As there only one active server users won't be able to access website during deployment of new codebase or updating of servers.
3.As a result of no load-balancer sever is not able to handle high traffic and this would likely cost system to crash.
4.System exposes client to cyber-attacks.
